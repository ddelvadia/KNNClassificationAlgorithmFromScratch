# KNNClassificationAlgorithmFromScratch
In this repository, I implimented the KNN Classification Algorithm from scratch for Irish dataset employing python.  My goal is to learn the KNN Classification Algorithm by writting the algorithm from scratch instead of using the python KNN classification library.  

The algorithm calculates the distance of unknown point to all other known points employing the euclidean distance.  Upon calculating all the distances, it sort the lowest to highest distance points using bubble sort algorithm (this algorithm is slow so I will be changing it to Quick Sort Algorithm).    

To test the KNN Algorithm written from scratch, I split the Irish Dataset in set of 80% and 20%.  The 80% train dataset was employed to classify the 20% test dataset. Upon observing the predicted result, I calculated the accuracy rate by calculating the correctly identify predicted class vs total number of test cases. 

After writing this algorithm, I learned how to impliment KNN Classification algorithm on Irish dataset by implimenting Top Down Design (breaking the very complex problem in to very small problems and implimenting it in python).
